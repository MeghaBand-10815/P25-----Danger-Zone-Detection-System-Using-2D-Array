# P25-----Danger-Zone-Detection-System-Using-2D-Array
The aim of this project is to create a Danger Zone Detection System that identifies and display the positions of danger zones in a 2D grid using array.

# Project Title
Danger Zone Detection using 2D Array in C

## Project Description
This project scans a 2D matrix to identify danger zones.
The value 1 represents a danger zone and 0 represents a safe zone.

## Purpose of the Project
The purpose of this project is to understand:
- 2D arrays
- Functions
- Nested loops in C programming

## Utility / Applications
- Can be used in map scanning systems
- Useful in security and safety applications
- Helps in understanding matrix traversal

## Future Scope
- Can be extended to real-time map analysis
- Can be implemented using GUI
- Can be upgraded to use dynamic memory

## What I Learned from This Project
- Learned how to declare and use 2D arrays in C
- Learned how to pass a 2D array to a function
- Practiced using nested loops for matrix traversal
- Understood how to use conditional statements
- Learned how to find and print positions of specific elements
- Gained experience in running C programs in VS Code
- Learned how to create and upload a README file on GitHub

## Output
Enter number of rows and columns:
2
2
Enter matrix elements (1 = Danger Zone, 0 = Safe Zone):
1
0
1
0

Entered Matrix:
1 0 
1 0 

--- Danger Zone Positions ---
Danger at position: (0, 0)
Danger at position: (1, 0)
